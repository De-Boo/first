# Tools Used
several tools where used in analysing this data, the tools are the best in this field for deep diving and collecting insite from a data set.

## Tools used:

**SQL:**
SQL was used as the tool for quering the data set, sql provided the best insite on this data set. Using sql allowed me to fuuly manipulate the data and analyse complex data to give out the best information.

**Postgres:**
Postgres was used as the database mangement system, ideal for handling job postings data ssets.

**VScode:**
Visual studio code was used as it is good for handling a wild varity of programming languages including SQL Visualization.

**Git and GitHub:**
Good for version control and ease in sharing my code to the public or partners ensuring efficient project tracking.

# The Analysis
each query looks at a specific aspect of the data driven role jobs and skills.

How i approached each question.
### Top 20 paying data analysis job
Here the data analysis jobs  were filtered according to health insurance  annual salary and remote jobs status; specifically working from home.
````sql
SELECT 
  job_id,
  job_title_short,
  job_schedule_type,
  job_no_degree_mention,
  job_health_insurance,
  job_country,
  job_work_from_home,
  salary_year_avg
FROM job_postings_fact
WHERE job_health_insurance = 'true'
  AND salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
  AND job_work_from_home = 'true'
ORDER BY salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 20;
````
### Skills required for these type of job roles
Here we looked at the top skills job seekers must have to be able to apply for data driven roles.
````sql
WITH top_20_paying_jobs AS (
  SELECT job_id,
    company_dim.company_id,
    job_title_short,
    job_schedule_type,
    job_no_degree_mention,
    job_health_insurance,
    job_country,
    job_work_from_home,
    salary_year_avg
  FROM job_postings_fact
    LEFT JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
  WHERE job_health_insurance = 'true'
    AND salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
    AND job_work_from_home = 'true'
  ORDER BY salary_year_avg DESC
  LIMIT 20
)
SELECT top_20_paying_jobs.*,
  skills_job_dim.skill_id,
  skills_dim.skills
FROM top_20_paying_jobs
  INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON top_20_paying_jobs.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
  INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
LIMIT 20;
````
### Top in demand skills for data driven job roles
After looking at the skills required for these type of roles, further analysis was conducted to find out among those skills which are are highly demanded by employers.
````sql
SELECT skills_dim.skills,
  count (job_postings_fact.job_id) AS top_demand_skill
FROM job_postings_fact
  INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON job_postings_fact.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
  INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
WHERE job_postings_fact.job_title_short LIKE '%Data%'
  OR job_postings_fact.job_title_short LIKE '%Analyst%'
GROUP BY skills
ORDER BY top_demand_skill DESC
LIMIT 5;
````
### Skills with the highest salary structure
We looked at the skills that has the highest payout.
````sql
SELECT skills_dim.skills,
  ROUND (avg(job_postings_fact.salary_year_avg)) AS avg_salary
FROM job_postings_fact
  INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON job_postings_fact.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
  INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
WHERE (
    job_postings_fact.job_title_short LIKE '%Data%'
    OR job_postings_fact.job_title_short LIKE '%Analyst%'
  )
  AND salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY skills
ORDER BY avg_salary DESC
LIMIT 10;
````
### Optimum skills to learn
Knowing the highest skill by payout is good, but understanding which skill that will give you bettr satisfaction is better. The study looked int which skills will give you better chances of bein highered by employers. The code analysed the data set to find which skills are in high demand and also give out high payout.
````sql
SELECT COUNT (job_postings_fact.job_id) AS job_id_count,
  skills_job_dim.skill_id,
  skills_dim.skills,
  company_dim.name,
  ROUND (AVG(job_postings_fact.salary_year_avg)) AS job_demand_pament
FROM job_postings_fact
  INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON job_postings_fact.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
  INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
  INNER JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
WHERE job_postings_fact.salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY skills_job_dim.skill_id,
  company_dim.name,
  skills_dim.skills
ORDER BY job_id_count DESC,
  job_demand_pament DESC
LIMIT 15;
